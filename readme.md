You want to ride workouts instead of worrying about installing python and cloning git repositories ?
I completely understand, thats the reason i created a GUI Version of zwift-workouts-parser.
More time to ride workouts. :-)

Parse workouts from https://whatsonzwift.com and use it in Zwift ( if you want to try a single workout from a training plan without the need to start it or in your favorite riding software which can import *.zwo workout files)
